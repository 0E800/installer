INSTALLING
==========

Installing Maru on your device is easy!

Just run the interactive installer script and follow along.

Mac
---

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder, right-click (Control + click) "install",
and select Open.

Tip: Depending on your security settings, you may get a dialog that says
"install is from an unidentified developer. Are you sure you want to open it?".
Please select Open. See https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21769?locale=en_US for
more details. We promise we're not malware :)


Linux
-----

Open a terminal, cd to the unzipped installer, and run the "install.sh" script with:

    $ ./install.sh


Windows
-------

First, install the Google USB Driver to communicate with Nexus devices:

1.  Enable USB Debugging on your device (see HOW TO ENABLE USB DEBUGGING below)

2.  Download the driver from http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html

3.  Install the driver following the instructions on
    http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html#InstallingDriver

Then navigate to the unzipped installer folder and double-click "install".

Tip: We have found that installing the Google USB Driver can be very confusing.
You may need to select the driver for your device multiple times before
Windows finally installs it correctly. You may also need to wait while Windows
installs the driver a second time after your device boots into recovery mode.


UNINSTALLING / RESTORING TO FACTORY
===================================

If you've installed Maru and decided you want to get your device back to
the way it was, you can easily re-install your factory image with our
interactive uninstaller.

Grab a factory image for the Android version you would like from
https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#hammerhead and follow along.

NOTE: You will have to enable USB Debugging again even if you already did so for
installing Maru. (You must be a pro at this by now!)

Mac
---

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder, right-click (Control + click) "uninstall",
and select Open.

Tip: Depending on your security settings, you may get a dialog that says
"uninstall is from an unidentified developer. Are you sure you want to open it?".
Please select Open. See https://support.apple.com/kb/PH21769?locale=en_US for
more details. We promise we're not malware :)


Linux
-----

Open a terminal, cd to the unzipped installer, and run the "uninstall.sh" script with:

    $ ./uninstall.sh


Windows
-------

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder and double-click "uninstall".


You should now have a fresh factory installation on your device.


HOW TO ENABLE USB DEBUGGING
===========================

You'll see instructions to enable USB Debugging as the first step before
running our installer or uninstaller. Enabling USB Debugging is important
because it lets the Maru installer talk to your device.

1.  Go to the Settings app and scroll down to the System section

    NOTE: If you already have "Developer options"
    under System then go directly to #5

2.  Tap on "About phone"
3.  Tap "Build number" 7 times until you get a message
    that says you are now a developer
4.  Go back to the Settings app and scroll down to the System section again
5.  Tap on "Developer options"
6.  Ensure that "USB debugging" is enabled
7.  Tap "OK" if you see a dialog asking you to allow USB Debugging for
    your computer's RSA key fingerprint (you may have to do this multiple
    times unless you check "Always allow from this computer")

Remember that you will have to enable USB Debugging again whenever your
device factory resets (after unlocking your bootloader for example) or
completes a fresh install.
