UNINSTALLING / RESTORING TO FACTORY
===================================

If you've installed Maru and decided you want to get your device back to the way
it was, you can re-install your factory image with the following steps:

1. Download and unzip the factory image for the version of Android you would like to restore your device to from https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#hammerhead

2. Open up a terminal and add the "adb" and "fastboot" programs from the maru installer directory to your PATH:

    $ export PATH=/path/to/maru-installer:$PATH

Make sure you can access adb and fastboot by trying to run them:

    $ adb
    $ fastboot

If you get errors then your PATH isn't set up correctly.

3. Reboot your device into recovery mode (ensure it is connected to your computer first):

    $ adb reboot bootloader

4. Navigate to the directory you unzipped the factory images in and run the flash-all script:

    $ ./flash-all.sh

You should now have a fresh factory installation on your device.
