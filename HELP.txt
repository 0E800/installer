INSTALLING
==========

Installing Maru on your device is easy!

Just run the interactive installer script and follow along.

Mac
---

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder and double-click "install".


Linux
-----

Open up a terminal, cd to the unzipped directory, and run the "install.sh" script with:

    $ ./install.sh


Windows
-------

First, install the Google USB Driver to communicate with Nexus devices:

1. Download the driver from http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html

2. Install the driver following the instructions on http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html#InstallingDriver

Then navigate to the unzipped installer folder and double-click "install".

Tip: We have found that installing the Google USB Driver can be very confusing.
You may need to select the driver for your device multiple times before
Windows finally installs it correctly. You may also need to wait while Windows
installs the driver a second time after your device boots into recovery mode.


UNINSTALLING / RESTORING TO FACTORY
===================================

If you've installed Maru and decided you want to get your device back to the way
it was, you can easily re-install your factory image with our interactive uninstaller.

Grab a factory image for the Android version you would like from
https://developers.google.com/android/nexus/images#hammerhead and follow along.

NOTE: You will have to enable USB Debugging again even if you already did so for
installing Maru. (You must be a pro at this by now!)

Mac
---

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder and double-click "uninstall".


Linux
-----

Open up a terminal, cd to the unzipped directory, and run the "install.sh" script with:

    $ ./uninstall.sh


Windows
-------

Navigate to the unzipped installer folder and double-click "uninstall".


You should now have a fresh factory installation on your device.
